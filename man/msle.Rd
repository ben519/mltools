\title{Mean Square Logarithmic Error}
\usage{
msle(preds = NULL, actuals = NULL, weights = 1, na.rm = FALSE, alpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{preds}{A vector of prediction values in [0, 1]}

\item{actuals}{A vector of actuals values in {0, 1}, or {FALSE, TRUE}}

\item{weights}{Optional vectors of weights}

\item{na.rm}{Should (prediction, actual) pairs with at least one NA value be ignored?}

\item{alpha}{(defualt = 1) See the formula details. Primary purpose is to prevent taking log(0)}
}
\description{
Calculate Mean-Square-Logarithmic Error (Deviation)

For the ith sample, Squared Logarithmic Error is calculated as SLE = (log(prediction + alpha) - log(actual +
alpha))^2. MSE is then mean(squared logarithmic errors). alpha (1 by default) can be used to prevent taking log(0)
for data that contains non positive values
